#Starting with 5, generate each term by multiplying the previous term by 3 and subtracting 4.
#Starting with 25, generate each term by taking half of the previous term if it's even, or multiplying by 
#3 and adding 1 if it's odd. (This is an instance of a Collatz sequence.)
#Starting with 0,1, generate each term by adding the previous two terms. (This is the famous Fibonacci sequence.)
#Starting with 2,âˆ’3, generate each term by adding the product of the previous two terms.
